# Be-My-Boo

A fun little site to invite someone to be your boo of the season! 

This was a project to get more familiar with javascript, and practice trying a fun new application of HTML and CSS styling with a runaway button. 
Fully inspired and based on the valentines project by [Stephanie Ran] (https://github.com/stephanieran/valentines).
